A Celeste mod to give the player customizable hats, with external mod support and quick hat swapping.

Inspired by Maddy Crown by norah, Art from snomii, cyber, and intro car (trust me real collab with real intro car celeste from prologue).
Animated boat sprite made completely by Ali

Do not read my code it is awful.

You can find a tutorial for making custom hats to upload on gamebanana here => https://github.com/snomii/Hateline/wiki/Custom-Hat-Tutorial
